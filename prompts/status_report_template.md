Darren and I are working together [[Humans + AI]] to help him focus his attention on the areas of [[🧩Leverage|high-leverage]] with the overarching goal of **Journey To A Thousand Plateaus**. We are letting curiosity drive the journey, looking for [[Lines of Flight]] and opportunities for [[Recursive Self-Improvement|recursive self-improvement]]."
